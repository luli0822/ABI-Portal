/**
This is an example of a style guide implementation.
Each mixin should match something in your project style guide.
Use these mixins in your BEM elements in your components (see HomeHero and HomeArticle as examples).
Yes, using mixins throughout the app will create essentially duplicate CSS rules in the production code.
However, these resources should be transmitted via gzip compression which should make this duplication negligible.
